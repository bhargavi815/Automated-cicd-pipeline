# CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a web application using various tools and services, including Git, Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS Cloud.

The goal of this pipeline is to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring a smooth and consistent delivery of the web application.
## CI/CD Workflow

1. **Source Code Management (SCM):**
   - The project source code is managed on GitHub.

2. **Continuous Integration with Jenkins:**
   - Jenkins is used for continuous integration.
   - Jenkins is configured to listen to GitHub Webhooks to trigger builds automatically on code pushes.

3. **Build with Maven:**
   - Maven is used for project build automation.
   - The Jenkins pipeline includes a Maven build step to compile, test, and package the application.

4. **Static Code Analysis with SonarQube:**
   - SonarQube is integrated into the pipeline to perform static code analysis.
   - Quality gates are defined to ensure that only high-quality code is promoted.

5. **Artifact Repository with Nexus:**
   - Nexus is used as the artifact repository to store and manage build artifacts.
   - The Jenkins pipeline deploys the application artifacts to Nexus.

6. **Docker Containerization:**
   - Docker is used to containerize the application.
   - The Jenkins pipeline builds a Docker image and pushes it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

7. **Kubernetes Orchestration:**
   - Kubernetes is used for container orchestration.
   - The Jenkins pipeline deploys the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Kubernetes manifests define the deployment, services, and other resources.

8. **Cloud Support with AWS:**
   - AWS is used as the cloud provider.
   - The AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is utilized for managing the Kubernetes cluster.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Jenkins
- Maven
- SonarQube
- Nexus
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AWS CLI

### Configuration

1. **GitHub Webhooks:**
   - Configure a webhook in your GitHub repository to trigger Jenkins builds on code pushes.

2. **Jenkins Configuration:**
   - Set up Jenkins with the necessary plugins (GitHub, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).
   - Configure Jenkins credentials for GitHub, Nexus, Docker registry, and AWS.

3. **AWS Configuration:**
   - Set up an AWS account and configure the AWS CLI with the necessary credentials.
   - Create an EKS cluster in AWS.

4. **Nexus Configuration:**
   - Set up Nexus and configure it as the artifact repository in your Maven settings.xml.

5. **SonarQube Configuration:**
   - Set up SonarQube and configure it in your Maven settings.xml for code analysis.

6. **Kubernetes Configuration:**
   - Configure kubectl with the credentials for your EKS cluster.

### Running the Pipeline

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.

2. Configure the Jenkins pipeline to point to your forked repository.

3. Make changes to the code and push them to your GitHub repository.

4. The Jenkins pipeline will automatically trigger, orchestrating the CI/CD workflow.
